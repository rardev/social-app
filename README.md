# social-app

@rardev - 25Jul2022:
This app is a proof of concept/practice project. It will be used to demonstrate and build skills with relevant languages.

The primary proposed languages at this time will be C++ for a desktop client and HTML CSS and JS for web portal.

The project goal is to create something usable which can serve as a point of reference for future projects and ideas.

Change added by Anthony to practice using gitHub
